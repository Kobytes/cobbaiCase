Rails app by [Kobytes](https://github.com/Kobytes/)

Unfortunately incomplete : 
[X] Build the application
[X] Create a postgresql database
[X] Build the architecture
[~] Seed the app with restcountries data (only view, I was not able to convert the JSON data into a Ruby object so I did not entirely seed the app with the data)
[X] A user can authenticate
[~] A user can access the list of countries (but i don't implement the pagination)
[] A user can access the weather of a country
[] A user can add countries to its favorites
[] A user can view a list of his favorite countries
